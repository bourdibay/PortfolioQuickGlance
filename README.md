# PortfolioQuickGlance
Simply visualize a list of stocks, without any api or registration needed.
To do so I just scrap the html pages of [Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com)

This is my first project using Kotlin and androidx libraries.

Ideas for improvement: have a left Navigation drawer where we can create/select a list of ISIN codes to display.
